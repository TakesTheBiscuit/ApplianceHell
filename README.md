 ApplianceHell Game

## Building

- npm i

## Running locally

- npm start
- visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 in a browser

## Coding

- modify index.html and refresh your browser (no hot module reload here)

## Publishing

## Playing

- use WASD to collect stars
- you can collect many stars at a time
- once you have collected all visible stars take them to the washing machine
- colliding with the washing machine is enough to drop the stars
- collect all stars in a 'round' and the washing machine will run
- once the washing machine finishes a cycle more stars spawn
- collect all stars in all rounds until you see 'YOU WIN'
- record your time, or don't

## Playtest feedback and future ideas

- more machines
- randomise the platform elements
- gravity/jump mechanism is a bit odd
